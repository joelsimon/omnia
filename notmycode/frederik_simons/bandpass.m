%
% Filters signal 'x' with filter 'tipe' and corner
% frequencies 'cohi' and 'cohi' in Hz with 'npol' the 
% number of poles and in 'npas' passes. Sampling rate is 'Fs' in Hz.
%
% INPUT:
%
% x         The signal
% Fs        Its sampling frequency
% colo      The lower corner frequency
% cohi      The higher corner frequency
% npol      The number of poles
% npas      The number of passes
% tipe      The filter name
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% xf      The filtered signal
%
% Compare in SAC bp butter co 0.05 5 n 2 p 1
%
% Returns the npas frequency response and the effective pass band for
% one or two passes (3 dB level)
%
% You'll see that plot(F,decibel(HABS2)) (this is what freqz plots)
% shows how' you concentrate between cohi and colo at the 
% 3 dB-level

% note that EPB output (via bpmin.m, decibel.m) is broken.  Also, did
% FJS ever have his own detrend.m or has this always called MATLAB's
% builtin (to remove the linear best fit?).  My old notes here seem to
% imply a previous version failed because FJS had a conflicting
% detrend.m.
