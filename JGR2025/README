addpath('src')

NB: I was somewhat careless with "elevation" (up is positive) and "depth" (down
    is positive) when generating a some of the source code / data files. Not
    worth my time to go back and recompile everything; hopefully their
    distinction will be clear enough in context. I've added some sanity checks
    in places you could really get in trouble.
