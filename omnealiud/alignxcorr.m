%
% Aligns signals common to x1 and x2, reports their delays, returns truncated
% and equal-length segments aligned on common signal, and reports their cross
% correlations.
%
% To align, one must add the delay to x1, or subtract the delay from x2.
%
% `delay` is the sampling-interval delay (of the correlated signal) of x2 w.r.t. to x1:
%  * POSITIVE delay means that the signal in x2 is LATE compared to x1
%  * NEGATIVE delay means signal in x2 is EARLY compared to x1
%
% See `alignxcorrutc` to convert from arbitrary sample space to seconds.
%
% This is just a wrapper for alignsignals.m and xcorr.m; see there for further
% details (e.g., if a signal is periodic only the first delay is returned...).
%
% Input:
% x1        A signal with something in common with x2
% x2        A signal with something in common with x1
% scaleopt  `xcorr` scaling ('biased' [def], 'unbiased', 'coeff', or 'none')
%
% Output:
% delay    How delayed the signal in x2 is, compared to x1, in samples
%              (x2 is delayed, "late", w.r.t. x1 if delay is positive)
% mc       Maximum (in the sense of absolute value, but this may be negative)
%              of cross-correlation sequence
% xat1     Aligned and truncated x1 (the correlated signal portion common to x2)
% xat2     Aligned and truncated x2 (the correlated signal portion common to x1)
% xat1_pt0 Number of uncorrelated samples removed from start of x1 to make xat1
% xat2_pt0 Number of uncorrelated samples removed from start of x2 to make xat2
% sx1*     Total number of samples cut (before and after correlated signal)
%              from x1 to generate xat1
% sx2*     Total number of samples cut (before and after correlated signal)
%              from x2 to generate xat2
% px1      Percentage of samples cut from x1 to generate xat1
% px2      Percentage of samples cut from x2 to generate xat2
% c        Cross-correlation sequence of aligned and truncated sequences
%
% *`delay` and `sx1\2` are sampling intervals [sec=delay*fs], not [sec=(delay-1)*fs]
%   (do not remove 1 before multiplying by sampling frequency to convert to time)
%
% Ex1:
%    x1 = [1 2]
%    x2 = [0 0 1 2 0 0]
%    [delay, mc, xat1, xat2, xat1_pt0, xat2_pt0, sx1, sx2, px1, px2, c] = ALIGNXCORR(x1, x2, 'coeff')
%
% Ex2: (find the signal x2, an ADVANCED (negative delay) pure sine wave, in x1)
%    % Generate pure sin wave.
%    x1 = sin(linspace(0,2*pi,100)); x2 = x1; % x2 = -resample(x2,2,1);
%    % Delay the signal in x1 by 100 samples, append 100 more, and add noise.
%    x1 = [zeros(1,100) x1 zeros(1,100)]; x1 = x1 + 0.1*randn(1,length(x1));
%    % Compute aligned cross correlation.
%    [delay, mc, xat1, xat2, xat1_pt0, xat2_pt0, sx1, sx2, px1, px2, c] = ALIGNXCORR(x1, x2, 'coeff')
%    % Plot inputs.

%    % To align you must subtract the delay from x2.
%    % (+1 because the signal in x1 starts at index 101)
%    align_x2t = [-delay+1:-delay+length(x2)];
%    % Alternatively: align_x2t = [xat1_pt0+1:xat1_pt0+length(x2)];
%    subplot(3,1,3); hold on; plot(x1, 'k'); plot(align_x2t, x2, 'r');
